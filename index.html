			<p>Marshall Musser was born on May 31, 1999 in Atlanta, Georgia. Growing up with two brothers, his interests were often rooted in competition and sports, however, he always had particular interests in school. While attending North Atlanta Highschool, Marshall entered the IB diploma program which provided a path to have a variety of college choices, ultimately choosing the University of Georgia.
		 Marshall is the proud owner of two dogs, Coors and Butch.</p>

		 <p>Marshall excelled on debate team at North Atlanta. He loves to bake cookies and has a fond interest in penguins. At one time, he baked penguin-shaped cookies. One of his debates included the importance of saving penguins, and keeping the ice caps from melting. Penguins are a rare bird, with many of them being at risk from human activity. Three penguin species are endangered, nine are vulnerable, and two are near threatened. Penguins are in danger because of various reasons such as: hunting them for oil, taking their eggs, destroying their natural environment, and various other reasons. We need to do all that we cans for these little guys so that they can get off the endangered and vulnerable species lists, and grow in population size once again.</p>
		 <p>There are 17 known penguin species in the world, and everyone has their own favorites. In my opinion, the top 3 species to bake cookies of are as listed below:</p>
			 <ol>
  				<li>The Emperor Penguin</li>
 				<li>The Yellow-eyed Penguin</li>
				<li>The Macaroni Penguin</li>
			</ol>
